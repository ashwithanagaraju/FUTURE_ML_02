# Customer Churn Prediction System

This project implements a customer churn prediction system using historical customer data to identify users at risk of leaving a service. The solution addresses a key business challenge by applying machine learning techniques to analyze customer behavior and estimate churn likelihood, supporting data-driven retention strategies.

The project applies an end-to-end predictive modeling pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification modeling, to capture patterns associated with customer attrition. Multiple models are evaluated to balance predictive performance and interpretability, with results analyzed to extract actionable insights relevant to business decision-making.

The system demonstrates the practical application of machine learning for customer analytics, highlighting how predictive models can be used to anticipate churn risk and inform targeted intervention strategies in real-world business environments.
