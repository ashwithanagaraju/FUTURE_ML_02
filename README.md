# Customer Churn Prediction System

This project implements a customer churn prediction system that analyzes historical customer data to identify users at risk of leaving a service. The solution addresses a critical business challenge by applying machine learning techniques to model customer behavior and estimate churn likelihood.

The project focuses on building an end-to-end predictive modeling pipeline that balances performance and interpretability, enabling insights that can support targeted retention strategies. The system demonstrates how predictive analytics can be used to anticipate customer attrition and inform data-driven decision-making in customer-centric business environments.
